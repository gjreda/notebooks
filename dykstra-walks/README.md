Dykstra Walks
=============

Lenny Dykstra went on a radio show and said he used to dig up dirt on umpires in order to get a more favorable strike zone. However, he's been known to say some ridiculous things over the years.

The following analysis seeks to validate his claims by modeling his 1993 and 1994 walk rates as a beta distribution based on his career numbers prior to each year. From there, we can simulate a credible range of walk totals we'd have expected for both the 1993 and 1994 seasons.
